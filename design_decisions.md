## üß† Architectural Decisions

### 1. Django + Django REST Framework
- Chosen for its maturity, rapid development cycle, and built-in admin.
- DRF simplifies serialization, filtering, pagination, authentication, and view scaffolding.

### 2. PostgreSQL
- Robust, scalable, and well-supported in Docker environments.
- Used ForeignKey and OneToOneField to maintain normalized model relationships.

### 3. Faker for Data Seeding
- Faker generates synthetic but realistic employee, attendance, and performance data.
- Exposed as a custom Django management command: seed_employees.

### 4. Docker + Docker Compose
- Used to isolate and containerize the application stack (web + db).
- Simplifies deployment across environments.
- .env-based config injects secrets and DB settings securely into containers.

### 5. Token-Based Authentication
- Implemented basic token auth using DRF‚Äôs TokenAuthentication.
- Suitable for securing APIs during prototyping and small-team use.

### 6. API Documentation with Swagger
- Integrated using drf-yasg for interactive documentation.
- Available at /swagger/, useful for testers, stakeholders, and devs.

### 7. Logging
- Basic error and usage logging configured in settings.py using Django‚Äôs logging framework.
- Useful for debugging and monitoring requests.

### 8. Health Check Endpoint
- Lightweight endpoint at /health/ returns HTTP 200 for readiness probes and monitoring.

### 9. CSV Export
- Implemented /employees/export/ to allow CSV download of employee records.
- Useful for offline analysis and reporting.

### 10. Custom Admin UI
- Enhanced with list_display, list_filter, and search_fields for Employee, Attendance, and Performance models.
- Enables better manual inspection of seeded data.

## ‚è≥ Trade-offs in 3-Hour Limit

- Authentication implemented via token; skipped refresh/blacklist mechanisms for speed.
- Minimal frontend visualizations; added backend support with Plotly-ready data and basic templates.
- Prioritized backend structure, data modeling, API correctness, and deployability.
- Skipped async tasks, Celery, and real-time updates due to scope/time constraints.

## üå± Future Enhancements

- OAuth2/JWT-based auth + permissions
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Frontend dashboard using React/Vue
- Historical performance analytics
- Asynchronous background tasks (Celery + Redis)
- Caching layer for analytics APIs
